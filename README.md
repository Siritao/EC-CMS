# Ensemble Clustering via Co-association Matrix Self-enhancement

This is the demo of our paper: _Y. Jia, S. Tao, R. Wang and Y. Wang, Ensemble Clustering via Co-Association Matrix Self-Enhancement._ ([[preprint version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05937v2)] [[published version](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10061157/)])

You can directly clone this repo and run `demo_EC_CMS.m`.
> Notes:
> 
> * Hyper-parameters `alpha` and `lambda` are tunable for better performance.  
> * All of our experiments use the seed `rng(1)` for re-producing.
