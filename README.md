# Ensemble Clustering via Co-association Matrix Self-enhancement

This is the source code of our paper: [Ensemble Clustering via Co-association Matrix Self-enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05937v1).  
You can directly run the `demo_EC_CMS.m` file.  
> Hyper-parameters `alpha` and `lambda` are tunable for better performance.  
> Note that all of our experiments use the seed `rng(1)` for re-producing.
